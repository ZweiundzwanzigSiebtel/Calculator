# Calculator
A powerful calculator for developers.
It is based on the inbuilt Calculator App on MacOS in "Programmer" Mode.
I use this tool a lot, but it has its limitations.

## TODO:

- [ ] from parser create AST then evaluate AST expression.
- [ ] binary, dec and hex output
- [ ] support for binary operators XOR, NOR, AND, OR, << and >>.
- [ ] config file (e.g. always show binary representation);
